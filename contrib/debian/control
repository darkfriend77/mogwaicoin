Package: mogwaid
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: peer-to-peer network based digital currency - daemon

 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Mogwai Core

 .
 This package provides the daemon, mogwaid, and the CLI tool
 mogwai-cli to interact with the daemon.

 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Mogwai Core
 is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.

 This package provides mogwai-tx, a command-line transaction creation
 tool which can be used without a mogwai daemon.  Some means of
 exchanging minimal transaction data with peers is still required.
